import React from 'react';

export function CONTACT() {
  return (
    <div className="section-container">
      <hr />
      <h1>Contact Me</h1>
      <p>This is where I'm going to add my contact information. I'll be including my email address, LinkedIn, GitHub, (maybe contact form idk), and a download of my resume.
        Almost a repeat of the HERO section at the top, but this is my call for action lol.</p>
    </div>
  );
